# CMB_powerspectrum_animations

Very simple script to make animations that show how the CMB power specrrum changes as you change parameters. For this to work you need pycamb installed. 
There are comments in the script explaining details. The examples are now TT only, but it is easy to look at other spectra as well (including lensing) 

Great for presentations or educational purposes!
Enjoy
